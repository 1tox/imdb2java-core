<p>
IMDB regularly provides plain text data files, called <e>interfaces</e>, that stores useful informations about movies, actors, genre, ratings, etc. These files can be held locally by downloading them at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces">http://www.imdb.com/interfaces</a>
</p>
<p>
This project provides parsers for converting plain text IMDB movies interfaces into Java objects. It's a first step before inserting these objects into any kind of database.
